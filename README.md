<h1 align="center">DISEASE PREDICTION & MEDICAL RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM</h1>
<p align="center">
  <b>A MACHINE LEARNING BASED HEALTHCARE ASSISTANT</b>
</p>


## 🌟 OVERVIEW
This project is an intelligent healthcare system that predicts possible diseases based on user-input symptoms and provides helpful recommendations such as **medications, diets, precautions, and workouts**.  
It uses a **Random Forest Machine Learning model** trained on a structured medical dataset and is deployed with a simple **Flask web interface** for easy accessibility.

## ✨ FEATURES
1. **Symptom-Based Prediction**  
   - Enter multiple symptoms to get possible disease outcomes.  

2. **Medical Guidance**  
   - Recommends suitable **medications, diet plans, precautions, and exercises**.  

3. **Trained ML Model**  
   - Uses a **Random Forest Classifier** trained on a curated dataset.  

4. **Interactive Web App**  
   - Built using Flask and HTML templates for user-friendly interaction.  

5. **Data-Driven**  
   - Includes multiple datasets for disease descriptions, medications, diets, and more.

## 📊 DATASET
The system uses a **Kaggle dataset** that includes:  
- `Training.csv` – Symptoms & disease mapping  
- `Symptom-severity.csv` – Severity levels of symptoms  
- `description.csv` – Disease descriptions  
- `medications.csv`, `diets.csv`, `precautions_df.csv`, `workout_df.csv` – Recommendation data
